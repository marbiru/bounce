# bounce
A little game where you need to slow a bouncing ball by just the right amount

+ a ball is bouncing under force of gravity
+ player presses "up" button repeatedly to slow down the ball (using a little "blaster" from underneath the ball)
+ the trick is to get the ball to stop as quickly as possible... but no quicker. If the ball ever starts going upwards when it shouldn't then the ball lifts off (what happens when the ball is bouncing upwards? Maybe then the player has to press down instead. Or maybe the ball never lifts off, the trick is just to press up/down at all the right times)
+ in future levels, gravity is higher (or similar tricks)
